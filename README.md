# Automated Online Exam Proctoring System Using Computer Vision and Hybrid ML Classifier
In our proposed system, we recorded students’ video and audio through their web camera and microphone. From those recorded videos a CSV for each student will be created where all the head and gaze movement’s features and audio features are recorded with respect to time. After that, for the prediction of cheating attempts, we are using a hybrid classifier. This classifier will flag the time where the student might be involved in cheating.
